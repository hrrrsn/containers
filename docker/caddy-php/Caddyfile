# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.  To use
# your own domain name with automatic HTTPS, ensure your A/AAAA DNS record is
# pointing to this machine's public IP, then replace `http://` with your domain
# name.  Refer to the documentation for full instructions on the address
# specification.

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    encode zstd gzip

    # Configures multiple PHP-related settings
    php_fastcgi unix//run/php-fpm/www.sock

    # Prevent access to dot-files, except .well-known
    @dotFiles {  
      path */.*  
      not path /.well-known/*  
    }

# As an alternative to editing the above site block, you can add your own site
# block files in the Caddyfile.d directory, and they will be included as long
# as they use the .caddyfile extension.
